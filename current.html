Student <br>&nbsp;<br><p style="text-align:justify;">Pelagic  broadcast  spawning  fish  (pelagophil)  is  a  threatened  reproductive  guild  of  fishes  emblematic  of  the  Great  Plains.  Dewatering,  combined  with  other  forms  of  fragmentation  (e.g.,  large  reservoirs),  act  synergistically  to  exacerbate  the  decline  of  pelagophils.  Stream  connectivity  is  hypothesized  to  be  important  for  migrations  by  some  pelagophils  and  downstream  drift  of  eggs  and  larvae.  It  is  likely  that  several  aspects  of  the  flow  regime  are  important  to  Great  Plains  fishes  and  determining  which  metrics  relate  to  overall  population  persistence  would  be  beneficial  to  support  proposed  management  actions.  To  improve  our  understanding  of  the  flow  needs  for  fishes  of  the  Great  Plains,  we  suggest  a  regional  perspective  relating  flow  loss  to  fish  persistence  would  offer  a  negotiating  point  for  water-  management  decisions.  Regional  flow-ecology  hypotheses  would  support  the  relationships  that  exist  across  a  broad  range  of  flows  and  it  would  apply  to  other  rivers  of  the  region  should  restoration  or  rehabilitation  become  an  option.  Identifying  flows  were  connectivity  occurs  and  possible  refuge  locations  at  low  flows  would  provide  substantial  support  for  a  minimum  flow  needed  for  population  persistence  and  identify  refuge  population  locations  under  extreme  conditions.  Lastly,  we  need  to  understand  how  connectivity  relates  to  movement  by  these  fishes.  Our  specific  study  objectives  are  1)  Develop  relationships  between  flow  regime  and  occupancy  by  pelagophils,  2)  Determine  the  relationship  among  habitat  connectivity  and  flow  and  identify  refuge  habitats  that  persist  during  low-flow  periods,  3)  determine  movement  during  the  non-breeding  season  when  most  of  our  uncertainty  is  greatest  related  to  movement  needs.

The  Red  River  basin  is  home  to  several  migratory  large-river  fishes  that  are  considered  species  of  conservation  concern.  My  research  focuseson  the  movement  patterns  and  population  dynamics  of  Blue  Suckers  in  the  lower  Red  River  basin  (downstream  of  Lake  Texoma).  We  used  acoustic  telemetry  to  document  Blue  Sucker  movement  at  a  coarse  resolution.  We  found  homing  to  the  same  tributaries  for  spawning  to  be  common  among  our  tagged  fishes,  but  when  fish  strayed,  it  was  common  to  an  undammed  tributary.  We  investigated  population  dynamics  of  Blue  Suckers  below  Denison  and  Hugo  dams,  and  modeled  the  trajectory  of  the  population.  Our  models  suggest  that  the  populations  are  declining  suggesting  the  populations  near  dams  are  sinks.  To  better  understand  the  variability  of  Blue  Sucker  recruitment,  we  investigated  the  relationship  between  Blue  Sucker  abundance  in  each  year  class  and  the  environmental  flow  conditions  at  the  time  each  year  class  would  have  been  born.  Preliminary  results  suggest  that  years  where  adult  Blue  Suckers  encounter  natural  flow  pulses,  rather  than  hydropeaking,  result  in  strong  year  classes  the  following  year.  Additionally,  low-flow  conditions  in  the  only  undammed  tributary  we  examined  resulted  in  stronger  year  classes.

There  are  perhaps  more  than  13  described  and  undescribed  populations.  However,  the  distribution  and  abundance  of  these  cave  crayfish  are  largely  unknown:  some  species  are  thought  to  be  very  rare  and  endemic  to  only  a  few  caves-  e.g.,  Delaware  County  cave  crayfish  C.  subterraneus,  restricted  to  limited  visual  census  data  of  about  34  individuals  and  known  from  only  three  caves  in  northeastern  Oklahoma  and  the  Oklahoma  cave  crayfish,  C.  tartarus,  restricted  to  visual  counts  of  less  than  100  individuals  and  also  known  from  only  three  caves.

Stream  fishes  are  declining  at  an  alarming  rate  largely  due  to  changes  to  flow  regimes.  Thus,  establishing  ecological  flow  relationships  is  an  important  component  of  stream  fish  conservation  and  management  strategies.  Flow-ecology  relationships  provide  a  legal  mechanism  to  balance  human  water-use  needs  with  the  ecological  integrity  of  aquatic  ecosystems.  However,  despite  improved  theoretical  perspectives  and  analytical  advancements,  stream  fish  flow-ecology  relationships  remain  poorly  understood.  For  example,  the  seemingly  simple  question  of  minimum  flow  requirements  for  a  stream  fish  species  is  often  unknown,  which  inhibits  effective  water  management  plans.  I  am  using  modeled  streamflow  data  and  assemblage-level  surveys  from  1980-2016  to  examine  flow-ecology  relationships  of  Red  River  stream  fishes.  Specifically,  I  am  implementing  a  hierarchical  Bayesian  modeling  approach  to  establish  relationships  between  local  colonization  and  extinction  of  stream  fishes  and  both  surface  and  groundwater  flow  metrics.  In  addition  to  providing  important  ecological  information,  the  model  will  be  used  to  predict  future  Red  River  stream  fish  distributions  under  different  climate  change  and  groundwater  pumping  scenarios.  This  project  will  help  guide  stream  fish  conservation  and  management  strategies  and  water-use  policies  in  the  south-central  United  States.  </p></br><br><b>Funding  agency: U.S.  Geological  Survey</b><br>&nbsp; </small></big></big></small><br></big></big></td></tr>

Competitive  interactions  have  been  shown  to  be  condition  specific.    For  example,  competitive  interactions  are  often  controlled  by  water  temperatures  and  thus,  may  only  occur  seasonally  or  under  certain  environmental  conditions.  Understanding  these  differences  is  beneficial  if  there  is  interest  in  identifying  conditions  where  stocking  may  be  problematic  for  native  fishes.  Because  competition  can  only  be  infered  from  field-based  studies,  I  will  conduct  artificial  stream  experiments  to  determine  short-term  growth  differences  among  native  fishes  and  native  fishes  with  trout  introduced.  Fish  densities  will  be  comparable  to  that  observed  in  the  field    and  fish  will  be  maintained  in  a  artificial  riffle/pool  complex  where  prey  items  will  be  introduced.  We  will  create  two  temperature  regimes  in  the  test  tanks  to  determine  if  competition  is  dependent  on  thermal  conditions  to  gain  insight  into  what  conditions  competition  is  more  or  less  problematic  (if  either).  We  will  use  DNA:RNA  ratios  to  measure  differences  in  short-term  growth  among  species.  Because  we  know  that  Rainbow  Trout  feed  heavily  on  crayfish,  I  will  also  compare  crayfish  demographics  at  locations  occupied  by  trout  and  those  that  are  not.  This  will  provide  additional  insight  to  indirect  interations  among  fish  species  as  crayfish  serve  as  a  primary  food  source  for  important  native  sport  fishes  that  prey  on  specific  size  classes  of  crayfish.

Rainbow  Trout  are  native  only  to  the  western  United  States  but  are  stocked  widely  throughout  the  country  to  increase  fishing  opportunities  for  anglers.  The  introduction  of  Rainbow  Trout  to  areas  outside  their  native  range  has  caused  concern  for  how  they  may  interact  and  potentially  compete  with  native  fish  species.  Specific  to  my  work,  streams  located  in  the  Ozark  Highlands  are  unique  in  that  they  areconsidered  relatively  pristine  and  support  a  diversity  of  native  fish  species  that  are  both  recreationally  important  and  of  conservation  value.  Additionally,  the  karst  geology  of  the  Ozark  Highlands  results  in  relatively  high  groundwater  contributions  to  many  streams,  providing  cool-water  refuge  during  summer  months  that  may  sustain  Rainbow  Trout  annually,  thereby    increasing  the  potential  for  negative  interaction  with  other  native  fishes  My  research  addresses  two  questions  1)  Do  Rainbow  Trout  displace  native  stream  fishes  from  their  selected  habitats  and  2)  What  is  the  movement  potential  and  survival  rate  of  Rainbow  Trout  across  seasons  in  Ozark  Streams?  I  work  in  streams  that  both  contain  and  are  absent  of  Rainbow  Trout,  using  a  combination  of  snorkel  surveys,  temperature  mapping,  habitat  assessments,  and  fish  tracking  to  address  these  questions.
